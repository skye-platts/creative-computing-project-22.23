## final-interaction-C++(OpenFrameworks)

OpenFrameworks project and compiled application for final experiment / implementation of interaction. The gender granulator is a real-time frequency-controlled speech modulator that causes speakers with higher fundmanetal frequencies to become less intelligible using granular synthesis. The user should wear noise-cancelling headphones so that only the audio output is audible. This interaction focuses on issues of inequality in computer audition. Women's voices are much less represented in datasets used to train machine learning algorithms for speech recognition. The gender granulator is designed to encourage the user to reflect on the following questions: 
- What privelliges do different voices afford?
- How do individuals use gender performance to be heard?
- How will computer intelligence understand complexities in humanity beyond discreet labels?
- How can we create universally accessible computer-human interactions?


In an installation context, multiple inputs and outputs could be daisy-chained together to create a "Telephone" game scenario where each individual is responsible for communication across the entire group. This interaction would put pressure on those individuals with higher-pitched voices to perform a masculine voice.
